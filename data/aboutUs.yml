    subtitle: "Empowering Students to Excel In The Industry"
    text: "<p>At Cédille, we believe that learning should never stop. As software and IT engineers, we understand that the industry is constantly evolving and that the skills and knowledge we gain in the classroom may not always be enough to secure our dream job or keep up with the latest developments. The truth is there is no denying that real-world experience is key for students to excel in their chosen fields.</p> 
           <p>That's why we exist - to bridge the gap between what we learn in school and the real-world skills and experience we need to excel in the industry. Our mission is to provide opportunities for students to practice and perfect their skills, develop a strong mindset and values, and make a difference through various projects that contribute to the community. </p>"
  - title: "Our Approach"
    subtitle: "Supporting Student Success Beyond The Classroom"
    text: "<p>We understand that learning doesn't stop in the classroom. Thus, we aim to provide a wide range of opportunities for students to practice and perfect their skills in software and IT engineering. Whether it's through working on projects, participating in hackathons, or attending workshops, our club provides hands-on experience that helps students develop the skills they need to excel in the industry.</p>
           <p>We believe that developing a strong mindset and values is just as important as technical skills. That's why we provide mentoring and guidance through industry professionals, as well as exposing students to the latest practices and trends. Our goal is to help students not only become better engineers but also become better individuals.</p>
           <p>Our club is also about making a difference. Through the projects we work on, we actively try to help clubs and organisations around us. At the end of the day it's not just about personal growth, we believe that by making a difference, we can motivate students to not only achieve their career goals but also leave a positive impact on the community.</p>"

      - title: "Web development"
        name: "web"
        active: "active"
        showActive: "show active"
        text: "<p>The web development field encompasses a wide range of areas, from design and UI/UX to front-end and back-end development, as well as content management. We provide opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in all of these areas.</p>
               <p>If web development is a field you are interested in, expect to be using tools such as <b>Figma</b> for design and UI/UX, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>React</b> for front-end development, and <b>WordPress</b> and <b>Ghost</b> for content management. </p>
               <p>Our projects also involve using back-end technologies such as <b>Hugo</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Go</b> to create dynamic and responsive web applications.</p>"
      - title: "Software development"
        name: "software"
        text: "<p>Our software development projects are designed to give students a chance to work with a variety of languages and tools.</p>
               <p>From <b>Python</b> to <b>Go</b> and <b>Rust</b>, we use a wide range of technologies to tackle different types of projects. We also place a strong emphasis on containerization and use technologies like <b>Docker</b> to develop efficient and scalable solutions.</p>"
      - title: "DevOps"
        name: "devops"
        text: "<p>We specialize in DevOps, a methodology that aims to streamline the software development process through automation and collaboration. We are focused on developing and implementing several Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) projects that automate the build, test, and deployment processes, while ensuring high-quality code using <b>CircleCI</b>, <b>Github Actions</b>, and <b>ArgoCD</b>.</p>
               <p>We also use <b>Terraform</b>, an infrastructure-as-code (IAC) tool, to automate the management of our Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). This allows us to quickly and efficiently provision and manage our infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, with greater consistency and scalability.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we utilize <b>Kubernetes</b>, a container orchestration platform, to simplify the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, we can ensure that our applications are highly available, scalable, and reliable.</p>
               <p>By joining our team, you'll have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge tools like CircleCI, Github Actions, and ArgoCD, while gaining valuable experience in the DevOps field. So, whether you're an experienced DevOps professional or just starting out, we welcome you to join our team and be part of a community dedicated to pushing the boundaries of DevOps.</p>"
      - title: "SRE"
        name: "sre"
        text: "<p>Our SRE projects focus on creating a highly reliable and scalable environment for the infrastructure that powers our applications and services. We use a variety of tools to achieve this, such as <b>Prometheus</b> for storing metrics and <b>Grafana</b> for visualizing them. By using these tools, we can provide monitoring and alerting of our cloud-native environments, helping us to identify and resolve issues quickly.
</p>
               <p>We also make use of <b>Groundcover</b>, which leverages eBPF to provide a better observability platform of Kubernetes. This tool allows us to monitor network traffic, system calls, and other kernel-level events in real-time, giving us greater insight into the performance of our Kubernetes cluster.</p>
               <p>Whether you're interested in working with tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Groundcover or simply learning about monitoring and scaling systems,
we have a place for you on our team.</p>"
